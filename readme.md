# Dreams and You


## A Visual Argument 
This is a visual argument targeted at musicians to not give up on their passions. I personally had a phase where I let myself use the 'not enough time' as a justification for not continuing to learn the guitar. Since I recently got back into it, I wanted to help convince others to not forget their passions as well.

I went with a non-serious style becuase I thought it would be the most approachable tone for my message. Just a light-hearted reminder. Shia LaBeouf had a very popular meme back in the day and the message was adjacent to mine, so it incorporated very nicely into my non-serious style.
