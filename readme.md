# Don't Let Your Dreams Be Dreams


## A Visual Argument 
This is a visual argument targeted at musicians to not give up on their passions. I personally had a phase where I let myself use the 'not enough time' excuse for not continuing to learn the guitar. Since I recently got back into it, I wanted to help convince others to not forget their passions as well.

Shia LaBeouf had a very popular motivational meme back in the day and the message was adjacent to mine, so its context incorporated very nicely into my visual argument.

## Reflection
For my visual argument, I went with a celestial space them because the message made me think of ‘shooting for the stars’ and to follow with that I knew that I wanted to push a constellation font. I drew the font myself to give the natural irregularity of constellations and then chroma-shifted GIMP’s sparkle brush tool to make the foreground stars. To add emphasis to the font, I duplicated the font layer and blurred the back layer. In my first version, it felt like images were disconnected from the font and drew attention away from it, so to add Balance, I had them point towards the font with arrow-like parts.  To get Shia to hold the guitar, I auto-selected his arms and cut-paste them to a separate layer above the guitar layer. I also added a ghost guitar add depth and to further draw attention in the direction of the font. I also had issues with signal-to-noise ratio in the first version, so in I decided to have 3 dominant foreground objects, 1 middle ghost guitar object, and used the sunset and space images to anchor the background layers. Overall, I think my final version turned out to be a nicely complete piece with a clear message to not give up on your passions. Don’t let your dreams be dreams!
