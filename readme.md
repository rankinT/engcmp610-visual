# Don't Let Your Dreams Be Dreams


## A Visual Argument 
This is a visual argument targeted at musicians to not give up on their passions. I personally had a phase where I let myself use the 'not enough time' excuse for not continuing to learn the guitar. Since I recently got back into it, I wanted to help convince others to not forget their passions as well.

Shia LaBeouf had a very popular motivational meme back in the day and the message was adjacent to mine, so its context incorporated very nicely into my visual argument.
